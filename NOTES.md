i have ideas and here i desperately try to organize them -- myst O-o

## Validator
### Goal
1) Spreadsheet editor esque interface? Or integrate with any Excel/CSV/spreadsheet file --> takes that file in
2) Validate and grade that data in different categories --> 
   1) Compare it to GTFS best practices -> score based on match, additive
   2) Compare it to GTFS requirements -> get partial credit back if first was not met!
   3) Search for optional fields -> extra credit from catenary's most generous TA
   4) Check date for last updated versus any major changes (OSM changes? agency alerts?) --> points docked for lack of maintenance
   5) Is the data 
3) Show any disreptances + suggested fixes like how clippy/rustc does it 
4) Agency gets their scorecard and their graded paper back XD
