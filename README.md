# Project Mangrove

## Summary
Transit Agency Report Cards (GTFS heath and network robustness)

## Objective
Analyze and rank transit agencies based on two metrics:
1) how well their GTFS data is formatted, how accesible this data is, and what extra features they include
2) how well their transit networks support riders

## What we hope to achive with this
- Encourage agencies to provide better data so riders can know, reliably, where and when they catch the vehicle they need
- Uphold GTFS standards and pick out good examples that new agencies can rely on
- Give more data for enthusiasts and planners to analyze :3

## Metrics
 GTFS data: 
- Does the agency provide all required fields in the proper format? Do they include optional fields too?
- Is the GTFS data easy to find?
- Is the data accurate?

Transit Network
- Are there important locations near stations/stops?
- Are there enough stops? Can people take transfers from these stops?
- Are there enough trips per day?
